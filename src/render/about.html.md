Optimism Brewing Company was founded by husband and wife [Troy Hakala and Gay Gilmore](http://troyandgay.com) in 2013. It took more than a year to get a location for the brewery and it is under construction now in the [Capitol Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_&#40;Seattle&#41;) neighborhood of [Seattle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle). We look forward to serving our first beers in early 2015.

Optimism, the name, came from the realization that optimism is *why* we do everything we do. Optimism is the reason we *can* build a brewery. Optimism is the reason we *are* building a brewery. Optimism is *how* we build the brewery. Optimism is fun. We tried to come up with a clever name that meant "optimism", but we're believers in [the KISS principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) so we simply named it Optimism.
