We got the key to [the building](/news/getting-a-building/) today. We don't own it until Monday, but they gave us the key so we can get inside and prepare. Our construction company has papered up the windows so it doesn't look deserted.

Demolition is scheduled to start on Wednesday to reduce the interior to one big empty box. Then we can start the seismic structural work and repairs to the roof that are necessary before we can begin the brewery construction.

In them meantime, we've been busy with the city's rules and regulations and working with the architects to lay out the brewing equipment.
