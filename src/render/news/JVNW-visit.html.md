Gay and I made a quick overnight trip to [JVNW](http://jvnw.com) in Canby, Oregon to see the
equipment and verify that everything is as ordered before it gets delivered. The
brewhouse vessels and the brewdeck is built and the piping is assembled. Other
than the inline thermometers and site gauges not being metric, everything looked great.

The 8 Unitanks and 2 Bright tanks waiting to be delivered to Seattle:

We should be ready to have them delivered mid-August, and possibly be brewing in
early September.
