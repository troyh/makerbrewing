The north half of the building is almost done being demolished. The mezzanine has been completely removed and most of the plaster has been taken off the walls, posts and ceiling.

Half of the south side of the building (behind the wall in the photo) is cordoned off and the sand-blasting is being finished today. Tomorrow, they'll start sandblasting the last quarter of the building.

The car-decking ceiling looks good except for some water damage in a few spots. The posts and beams look like they're in good condition still. The wall dividing the north and south parts of the building was constructed of planks, rather than studs, and should give us a lot of reclaimed wood to use for furniture.
