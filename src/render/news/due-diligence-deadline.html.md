Since [we signed the purchase agreement in November](../getting-a-building/), we've been doing our due-diligence on the building, i.e., inspecting the building to decide if we want to buy it. Today is the deadline. Nothing unexpected turned up, so we are going to continue with the purchase. The only thing that can stop it now is if the seller backs out of the deal or something so horrible arises that it's worth it to us to pay the penalty to get out of it.

So the dream of starting a brewery is really beginning. We're committed now. We've done our homework on the business plan for the last 10+ months. I hope we didn't make too many mistakes and/or bad assumptions!

The purchase should close at the end of March and we hope to start destruction and construction immediately. We have a lot of design and planning work to do between now and then, including figuring out what beers we'll brew.
