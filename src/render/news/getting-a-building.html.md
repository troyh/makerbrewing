It took us 8 months but we finally are moving forward with a building for the brewery. There's not many buildings that are suitable for a brewery, but quickly found a building that *could* work. It was 14,000 square feet and looked great on the inside with big wood beams but the outside was as bland as a building can be. It was a two-story building and breweries need to put heavy fermenting tanks on the ground floor, but the bottom floor had only 10-foot ceilings so the 13-foot tanks would have to stick through the upper floor or go outside. The building had a 50-space parking lot so that could work. In the end, we couldn't come to terms with the owner on the details of the purchase and we felt we were making too many compromises to fit a brewery in it, so we gave up and walked away.

During that process, we drove around Capitol Hill with a list of recent sales to get an idea of what other comparable buildings were purchased for. One of those building I thought would have been perfect for us: it's all on one level floor, has 20-foot ceilings and it has the character of an old building inside and out. Even though it was off the market, Gay called the agent that sold it to see what was happening with it. He told her it was sold to a developer and it was going to close within weeks -- developers take a year or more to close on a property because the amount of work they have to do for due diligence periods is so involved. She told him to call her if anything happens.

We found another building with two tenants, with one tenant leaving soon. Half the building wasn't big enough. The other tenant was an art supply chain store who was recently acquired by its competitor and the competitor already had a store in Seattle. We suspected they'd close this location and, if they did, we could take the entire building. We talked to the owner and he said that the tenant had no plans to leave and seemed surprised we'd ask. Two weeks later, we saw a sign on the window that the location was closing so we called him again and he was willing to talk. After many weeks of negotiating the terms of the lease they went silent suddenly. A week later, the owner had his agent email us to say that they're done negotiating with no explanation as to why. A couple months later, we heard that Starbucks came along and wanted to put a big coffee roastery in it. Of course the owner figured Starbucks was a safer tenant. Plus Starbucks signed a 40+ year lease.

Weeks later, the agent who sold the previously-sold building called. The buyer decided to back out of the deal at the last minute. We made an offer and eventually agreed to terms. It took 6 more weeks to get the Purchase Agreement negotiated, but today we signed it. Even better, we're paying significantly less than the first building we were trying to buy even though it's bigger, on one story, has much more curb appeal and is in a better location. But it does need much more work to get it into shape. We won't close until March 2014 and we have a lot of work to do between now and then, not the least of which is to do our inspections to figure out how much work it really needs.
