title: Trip to NYC for our logo
---

I did all but the last logo for our previous business and was never happy with them for long and had to make a new one every couple years. I wanted a great logo for the brewery and one that I'd be happy with for many years. I've learned over the years that if you can find talented and passionate people, they do great work. I went looking for who I thought was the best logo designer who ever lived. That's [Paul Rand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand). Unfortunately, he died in 1996.

So I went to the 2nd best: [Milton Glaser](http://www.miltonglaser.com). He told me that because he's good friends with Steve Hindy, the Brooklyn Brewery founder, and because he did their logo, he would never do another logo for a brewery. Next was [Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv](http://www.cgstudionyc.com). I was certain they'd also turn me down but they didn't. I was certain it'd be outrageously expensive, but they gave us the "non-profit or startup company rate". While it was not inexpensive, twice the price of other logo designers we talked to, it was reasonable.

We talked to them about the name, our view of what "Optimism" means to us and talked about what we like and don't like in logos. We've worked with designers of all kinds over the years and I knew these guys were good and that they understood us -- sometimes you just know. They said it'd take a few months. So we patiently waited.

When they contacted us telling us that they're ready, they demanded, err... suggested that we fly to NYC to see their concepts in person. We refused twice. We're internet people, we don't need to be in the same room to look at logos. But they were adamant, so we went.

Today, we visited their office in New York. We flew in last night and went out for dinner. Walking near the hotel, we happened upon the [Hudson Hotel](https://www.morganshotelgroup.com/hudson/hudson-new-york), a place we happened to stay in 1998 while visiting the city when we first started dating. Perhaps subconsciously, we named our son "Hudson" so we went inside for dinner and beers. The beers helped us adjust to East Coast time. The hotel has a nice outdoor courtyard, which felt great at night in the hot New York August weather.

The next morning, we taxied to C&G&H's office. We were met by a dog at the front door and were ushered to the conference room. Ivan Chermayeff was on a family vacation but Tom Geismar and Sagi Haviv presented the logos to us. They walked us through 8 (!) concepts. It's rare to find designers who can come up with 3 different concepts for anything. 8 is impressive. And all were good, they weren't just concepts, every one of them could be used as-is. Gay and I quickly narrowed it down to 3 or 4, 2 of which we agreed on.

We had lunch at [Birreria](http://www.eataly.com/nyc-birreria/) on the roof of [Eataly](http://www.eataly.com/nyc) and, after a walk on [The High Line](http://www.thehighline.org), to [The Ginger Man](http://www.gingerman-ny.com). It was a quick trip, but it's always fun to visit NYC.

We flew back home and let the designs gel with us for a few days. We talked to C&G&H again and gave us our feedback. They made a couple changes to 2 of the designs, but by that time, we knew which was our logo.

We told them which was our favorite -- the one you see on this site, obviously. They then came back with a new version, one with the bubbles tweaked so slightly I'd never have noticed. Perfectionists.
