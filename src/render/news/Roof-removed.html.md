The roof where the open-air courtyard and food trucks will go has been removed. The old
trusses on top of the building have also been disassembled and taken down,
giving us lots of old big timbers to use inside.

We're still waiting on the building permit for most of the construction to be
approved. The floor where the brewery will go will be removed this week and a
new floor will be poured and finished before the equipment can be installed next
month.
