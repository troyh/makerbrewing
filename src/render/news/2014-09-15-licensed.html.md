We are officially licensed by the [TTB](http://ttb.gov). We filed it on May 1, so it took 4.5 months (137 days), twice as long as we were expecting. Once our equipment is installed, we can have Washington State's Liquor Control Board come to inspect it and give us a state license. That should happen within a week after installing the equipment. The brewhouse and cellar equipment is currently scheduled to be delivered and installed October 2-8. So we could/should be brewing the first batches of beer in the second half of October.
