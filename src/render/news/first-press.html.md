The Puget Sound Business Journal published [an article](http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2014/04/why-did-two-ex-microsofties-pay-6-15m-for-this-old.html) about us. It was written without any information from us, which is impressive and quick. I assume Marc Stiles saw the closing documents filing, made a few calls and had enough to write an article. He did contact us via Facebook yesterday, but we didn't want to say anything to spoil the April Fool's Day joke we had planned.

It's been 15 years since we worked at Microsoft. How long will we be referred to as "ex-Microsoft"? Even I forget that we worked there. My first thought when I saw the headline was "I wonder who also bought a building in Capitol Hill".

The Capitol Hill Blog [was almost fooled](http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2014/04/april-fooling-costco-coffee-signs-go-up-at-broadwayunion/) by our April Fool's Day joke.
