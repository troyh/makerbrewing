Demolition on the interior of the building starts today. There's a mezzanine inside that will be taken down as well as plaster from the roof and some walls. We can't even go inside for several days due to some asbestos material that is being disposed of. The inside will be reduced to one big empty box.

We have to do some seismic structural work, which includes strengthening the existing structure with steel beams and adding steel posts and beams to support the roof, which needs quite a bit of repair. This will take a couple months, I believe.

We've settled on the layout for the brewing equipment with [JVNW](http://jvnw.com), the manufacturer, so the brewing equipment will start to be fabricated very soon and should be delivered mid-June. Now we can work with our architect to finish the design for the rest of the place. And we need to finish spec'ing and ordering all the other brewing equipment.
