Six years ago, in the Fall of 2007, I was suddenly and unexpectedly out of work (in a good way) for the first time since I was 10 or 11. My first thought was that it was time to fulfill my childhood dream of starting a brewery. Should I really do it? I took the founder of [Dogfish Head](http://dogfish.com) Sam Calagione's book, *Brewing up a Business*, on vacation with Gay and our 6 month-old daughter, Havana, intending to get excited about building a brewery. The book convinced me that it was too hard to build a brewery. Then I read *Beer School*, written by Steve Hindy and Tom Potter, the [Brooklyn Brewery](http://brooklynbrewery.com/) founders and it confirmed how hard a task it is.

There's always more reasons not to start a business (or do anything, for that matter): it's expensive, it's hard work, you're risking money and time and your future. And there's thousands of reasons not to start a brewery: as of this writing, there are over 2,000 craft breweries today making great beer. So competing will be tougher than it would have been 25 years ago when my dream started.

I kept telling myself this. I kept telling people who asked if I was going to start a brewery how stupid it'd be to do it. My wife kept encouraging me to do it, and I'd rattle off all the reasons not to. After 5 years of this, I got pretty good at talking myself out of it.

I had to keep talking myself out of it because I really did want to do it, even if it makes little sense. Once I realized that, I stopped talking about the reasons *not* to do it and started talking about the reasons *to* do it.

Coincidentally, today is 16 years to the day that I started working at Microsoft, which is how I landed in Seattle.
