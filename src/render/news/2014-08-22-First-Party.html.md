Our contractor, [Metis](http://www.metisconstructioninc.com), had a company party at the building for the families of their employees and for the sub-contractors. They set up a bouncy house for the kids and had food and, of course, beer. We even brought several growlers of our beer and gave out Optimism t-shirts.

The view from the roof:

I got to see all the stainless steel conduit for electrical, which looks very cool. And I went downstairs to the basement and discovered the guys installing the boilers and plumbing for the radiant heating system were still working.
