We filed for our big permit a couple weeks ago and that should take 2 months to get approved. In the meantime, work covered under the structural permit is continuing. The footings for the new posts were poured yesterday and the beams and posts will be installed soon. All the steel and some heavy equipment arrived today and Eva went to check it out:

We also got some good news that we are permitted to pour the concrete slab for the floor where the brewery equipment will go -- the liquid inside the tanks and vessels is so heavy a stronger floor is required, plus we are putting trench drains in the floor -- so we don't have to wait 2 months until the overall permit is approved. This means that we can pour the slab and cover it with a brewery floor coating, giving it plenty of time to cure before we put heavy things on it. This also means that we don't have to hold up delivery of all the brewing equipment. But we can't brew until the Federal Government's [Tax and Trade Bureau](http://ttb.gov) (TTB) and [Washington State's Liquor Control Board](http://www.liq.wa.gov) say it's okay to brew.

To get the okay, we have to first get our TTB license, which we've heard is taking up to 4 months to get. Before you can file for the license, you have to have drawings for where all the brewing equipment will go. Having decided that, we filed for our license on May 1 using a brewery attorney and he is expecting it in 2 months. Once we have that and the equipment is installed, we can apply for our license with Washington State, which should take just a week. We could be brewing in August if everything goes smoothly.

While all of that's going on, we're working on placing the orders for all the brewing equipment that we haven't yet ordered. Surprisingly, the longest lead-time of all the equipment is the kegs. It takes _4 months_ to get the kegs, 3 months to make them and 1 month to ship from Germany. So we're finalizing that order now.
