During the last week, we've had the first problem with construction. The old concrete slab is being removed so that a new floor in the brewery area can be poured. I had always planned to have stainless steel drains in the brewery. I knew that, Gay knew that but the plumber didn't know that. And we didn't realize that the drain bodies themselves had to be installed *before* the concrete floor is poured  -- I assumed (oops!) that the trenches were formed in the concrete and the drain bodies were simply dropped in. So we didn't realize that the plumber had to order the drains ahead of time.

The plumber, Jason at My PHD plumbing, ordered non-stainless steel drains without asking us what we wanted. When we found out, we told him that we wanted stainless steel drains and his reply was that it wasn't his fault. That's the wrong response. Responsible acknowledge mistakes and then fix them and move on. Irresponsible people refuse to admit mistakes so that they don't have to take on the responsibility to fix them. Unfortunately, Jason is the irresponsible type.

Because we were held-up, we made it clear to him that he needed to order the correct drains quickly. He spent a week pointing the finger at the contractor and refusing to fix the problem. We sat down with him and the contractor and talked about what we wanted and, again, told him that we are delaying the pouring of the floor until we get the drains here. The next day our contractor had drawings showing us exactly how the drains will work, we approved them and thought this problem was behind us. A week later, we asked if the drains had been ordered yet and they hadn't -- Jason was *still* spending his time blaming our contractor and then started blaming the supplier for refusing to take his order. Jason is a guy who is more concerned with taking credit and assigning blame than he is with getting things done.


Fortunately, just through random conversation with the contractor we learned that the drains were already ordered and when we found out that they weren't stainless steel, we told them to change the order. Unfortunately, it takes weeks to get new drains spec'd and delivered, pushing the pouring of the new floor back several weeks. Everybody was upset and there was pressure to forego stainless steel drains to stay on schedule. But I want stainless steel drains because they're easier to clean, they look clean when clean and they look dirty when dirty (so you know when they're clean) and they're very durable.

We had a good talk yesterday about the drains and how we can avoid permanently embedding plumbing in the concrete slab so it can be replaced if (read: when) it fails. We're still going to be delayed, but I'd rather get what I want later than what I don't want earlier.

Lessons learned:

1. More talking with the people involved is better than less talking
2. Everyone should verify decisions rather than make assumptions
