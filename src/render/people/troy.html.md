Early in life, I discovered two things that have been passions of mine ever since: software and beer. I was a thrash-metal computer nerd in high school (mid-1980s) who brought imported beer to parties and had to explain too often why I wouldn't drink American beer. Then [Jim Koch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Koch) created [Samuel Adams](http://www.samueladams.com) -- I lived on the east coast then, [Anchor](http://www.anchorbrewing.com) and [Sierra Nevada](http://www.sierranevada.com) were unknown to me -- and a small wine shop in my town carried it. I could finally drink a great American beer! I read news articles about Jim Koch and was inspired by his attempt to make great beer in America.

I decided I'd make my own brewery one day. With help from [Charlie Papazian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Papazian)&rsquo;s *The Complete Joy of Homebrewing*, I began homebrewing in 1992. Then a career in software got in the way.

A lot has happened in beer since then. There's now plenty of great American brewers and breweries that continue to inspire me and I'm drinking beers I never imagined 20 years ago. I spent almost 6 years talking myself (and my encouraging wife) out of starting a brewery. Still, I couldn't resist it and I understand, now more than ever, how short life can be. The time is now. I don't know if I will have a positive impact or repay beer for all it has given me, but I will try.
