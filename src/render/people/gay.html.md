Beer is the perfect beverage:  more sanitary than water, brewed for more than 7,000 years, and yet still evolving with an infinite variety of flavors.  Beer makes people feel good, and is even better with food and friends.  

Like most people of my age, I got my start drinking big corporate beer, but I was lucky to have my eyes opened to the possibilities of better beer during a trip to Europe, and then more fortunate, to spend the past 20 years in the best place for craft beer, the Pacific Northwest.   When anyone tells me they don’t like beer, I say they just haven't met the right beer yet. My goal for Optimism is to match people up with their perfect beer and make them feel great drinking it.  

Generally speaking, Troy is the creative side, and I’m the business side.  Optimism is our second company (our first was an online cooking community), so we are not strangers to starting things the we don’t know a lot about.  We like hard problems and learning new things about as much as we like beer.   If you have ideas to share for making sharing beer better, please let me know.
