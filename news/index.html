That should happen within a week after installing the equipment. The brewhouse and cellar equipment is currently scheduled to be delivered and installed October 2-8. So we could/should be brewing the first batches of beer in the second half of October.</p>

<p>The building has a cool connection to our home. The building was built in 1920 by Edward Sweeney to be a showroom for the Great Western Motors Company, one of the many car dealerships built on Capitol Hill at the time.</p>
<p><img src="/img/news/sweeney.png" alt="Edward Sweeney"></p>
<p>Before that, he owned a brewery, the Claussen-Sweeney Brewery and in 1893 his brewery merged with the Albert Braun Brewery and Bay View Brewery, the brewery owned by the man who built our house, Andrew Hemrich. That merger created Seattle Brewing and Malting Company, the brewery that created Rainier Beer and, at one point, was the largest brewery in the United States. That building still stands, mostly, <a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/architect/structures/11796/">in Georgetown</a>.</p>

<p>So the dream of starting a brewery is really beginning. We&#39;re committed now. We&#39;ve done our homework on the business plan for the last 10+ months. I hope we didn&#39;t make too many mistakes and/or bad assumptions!</p>
<p>The purchase should close at the end of March and we hope to start destruction and construction immediately. We have a lot of design and planning work to do between now and then, including figuring out what beers we&#39;ll brew.</p>

There&#39;s not many buildings that are suitable for a brewery, but quickly found a building that <em>could</em> work. It was 14,000 square feet and looked great on the inside with big wood beams but the outside was as bland as a building can be. It was a two-story building and breweries need to put heavy fermenting tanks on the ground floor, but the bottom floor had only 10-foot ceilings so the 13-foot tanks would have to stick through the upper floor or go outside. The building had a 50-space parking lot so that could work. In the end, we couldn&#39;t come to terms with the owner on the details of the purchase and we felt we were making too many compromises to fit a brewery in it, so we gave up and walked away.</p>

My first thought was that it was time to fulfill my childhood dream of starting a brewery. Should I really do it? I took the founder of <a href="http://dogfish.com">Dogfish Head</a> Sam Calagione&#39;s book, <em>Brewing up a Business</em>, on vacation with Gay and our 6 month-old daughter, Havana, intending to get excited about building a brewery. The book convinced me that it was too hard to build a brewery. Then I read <em>Beer School</em>, written by Steve Hindy and Tom Potter, the <a href="http://brooklynbrewery.com/">Brooklyn Brewery</a> founders and it confirmed how hard a task it is.</p>
