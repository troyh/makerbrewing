<p>The roof over the south half of the building is supported by a truss above the roof, which eliminates the need for posts inside the building to support the roof. But the truss is failing, looks terrible, and isn&#39;t enough to meet modern building code. Our options were to rebuild the truss or support it underneath with more posts and beams. We chose to put  posts and beams on the inside. The north half of the building has wooden posts every 20 feet so the south side will match the same spacing, but use steel instead. When this building was built, wood was cheap and steel was expensive. Today, steel is cheaper than wood, at least wood the size of these posts.</p>
<p>Holes were cut in the floor and the dirt is being dug out to pour concrete for footings to support the posts. The roof needs to be strong so we can put a 3-ton glycol chiller and a 2-ton steam boiler on the roof. Our boiler salesman visited today (in orange vest in photo) to give us the low-down on the boiler equipment and location advice.</p>

<p>The roof of the building was poorly-maintained for years and water damage has rotted away a beam on the west side of the building. They are building temporary supports on both sides to support the roof so they can replace the beam. Surprisingly, all the other beams look like they&#39;re in good condition.</p>
<p><img src="/img/news/IMG_0035.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking southwest from the northeast corner, an original wood demising wall separated the south from the north part of the building. This was commonly done 100 years ago as a fire barrier -- imagine that, using a flammable material to block flames. It used to run the entire length of the building but we&#39;ve removed most of it. This part will stay because it will become an exterior wall to the courtyard we&#39;re going to build.</p>
<p><img src="/img/news/IMG_0050.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The sandblaster sandblasted a small part of the exterior brick to see how it&#39;d look if we sandblasted the paint off the exterior. Another sandblaster suggested we not do it because the brick is &quot;unfired&quot; and would not withstand the sandblasting well. But it looks good to me and breweries should be brick, in my opinion. We need to do more investigation to see if we should do it.</p>
