I wanted a great logo for the brewery and one that I&#39;d be happy with for many years. I&#39;ve learned over the years that if you can find talented and passionate people, they do great work. I went looking for who I thought was the best logo designer who ever lived. That&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand">Paul Rand</a>. Unfortunately, he died in 1996.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>So I went to the 2nd best: <a href="http://www.miltonglaser.com">Milton Glaser</a>. He told me that because he&#39;s good friends with Steve Hindy, the Brooklyn Brewery founder, and because he did their logo, he would never do another logo for a brewery. Next was <a href="http://www.cgstudionyc.com">Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv</a>. I was certain they&#39;d also turn me down but they didn&#39;t. I was certain it&#39;d be outrageously expensive, but they gave us the &quot;non-profit or startup company rate&quot;. While it was not inexpensive, twice the price of other logo designers we talked to, it was reasonable.</p>
<p>We talked to them about the name, our view of what &quot;Optimism&quot; means to us and talked about what we like and don&#39;t like in logos. We&#39;ve worked with designers of all kinds over the years and I knew these guys were good and that they understood us -- sometimes you just know. They said it&#39;d take a few months. So we patiently waited.</p>
<p>When they contacted us telling us that they&#39;re ready, they demanded, err... suggested that we fly to NYC to see their concepts in person. We refused twice. We&#39;re internet people, we don&#39;t need to be in the same room to look at logos. But they were adamant, so we went.</p>
<p>Today, we visited their office in New York. We flew in last night and went out for dinner. Walking near the hotel, we happened upon the <a href="https://www.morganshotelgroup.com/hudson/hudson-new-york">Hudson Hotel</a>, a place we happened to stay in 1998 while visiting the city when we first started dating. Perhaps subconsciously, we named our son &quot;Hudson&quot; so we went inside for dinner and beers. The beers helped us adjust to East Coast time. The hotel has a nice outdoor courtyard, which felt great at night in the hot New York August weather.</p>
<p>The next morning, we taxied to C&amp;G&amp;H&#39;s office. We were met by a dog at the front door and were ushered to the conference room. Ivan Chermayeff was on a family vacation but Tom Geismar and Sagi Haviv presented the logos to us. They walked us through 8 (!) concepts. It&#39;s rare to find designers who can come up with 3 different concepts for anything. 8 is impressive. And all were good, they weren&#39;t just concepts, every one of them could be used as-is. Gay and I quickly narrowed it down to 3 or 4, 2 of which we agreed on.</p>
<p>We had lunch at <a href="http://www.eataly.com/nyc-birreria/">Birreria</a> on the roof of <a href="http://www.eataly.com/nyc">Eataly</a> and, after a walk on <a href="http://www.thehighline.org">The High Line</a>, to <a href="http://www.gingerman-ny.com">The Ginger Man</a>. It was a quick trip, but it&#39;s always fun to visit NYC.</p>
<p>We flew back home and let the designs gel with us for a few days. We talked to C&amp;G&amp;H again and gave us our feedback. They made a couple changes to 2 of the designs, but by that time, we knew which was our logo.</p>
<p>We told them which was our favorite -- the one you see on this site, obviously. They then came back with a new version, one with the bubbles tweaked so slightly I&#39;d never have noticed. Perfectionists.</p>
