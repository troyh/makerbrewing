<p>The building has a cool connection to our home. The building was built in 1920 by Edward Sweeney to be a showroom for the Great Western Motors Company, one of the many car dealerships built on Capitol Hill at the time.</p>
<p><img src="/img/news/sweeney.png" alt="Edward Sweeney"></p>
<p>Before that, he owned a brewery, the Claussen-Sweeney Brewery and in 1893 his brewery merged with the Albert Braun Brewery and Bay View Brewery, the brewery owned by the man who built our house, Andrew Hemrich. That merger created Seattle Brewing and Malting Company, the brewery that created Rainier Beer and, at one point, was the largest brewery in the United States. That building still stands, mostly, <a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/architect/structures/11796/">in Georgetown</a>.</p>

<p>From the State records of the building:</p>
<p>First owners and tenants: Edward Francis Sweeney and the Great Western Motors Company
The subject building was constructed in 1920 as an automotive showroom and service facility for the Great Western Motors Company. The owner of the property and developer of the building at that time was Edward F. Sweeney. [See historic photos pp. 39-41]</p>
<p>Sweeney was born May 10, 1860 in San Francisco and educated at St. Mary’s College there. He moved to Seattle in 1883 and founded Sweeney &amp; Rule brewery in Georgetown with a partner, but became the sole owner a few months later. In 1889, he reorganized and incorporated the firm as the Claussen-Sweeney Brewing Company with H. J. Claussen, and himself as president. By 1889, the brewery was producing a million gallons a year. In 1893, the Claussen- Sweeney brewery merged with the Hemrich family’s Bay View Brewery, and the Albert Braun Brewery, forming the Seattle Brewing and Malting Company. This would evolve a few years later into one of the largest breweries in the country.13 Sweeney initially served as an officer of the firm, but sold his interests in the brewery in 1906. He then expanded into finance, becoming a trustee of the National Bank of Commerce of Seattle, vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, as well as a developer of real estate projects. He built and operated the Savoy Hotel on Second Avenue in 1906, until selling it in 1911.1</p>
