We filed it at the beginning of May and the city told us <a href="/news/permits">it&#39;d take 2 months</a>. It took almost 4 months. And we spent so much time on it covering all our bases that they didn&#39;t even have many questions about it, which would&#39;ve delayed it even further. Our work is small and straightforward compared to all the huge development projects going on in Seattle these days. Our permit should not have required as much time as it did.</p>
<p><!--more-->
The city is so slow that it took over a week once the permit was officially approved for someone to click a button to print the permit! It&#39;s amazing that anything gets built in this city.</p>
<p>During this process, I had dinner with a friend who does development projects around Salt Lake City. He told me that to get a building permit in Salt Lake City, the inspector comes to the site with you, you simply tell him what you&#39;re planning to build (&quot;walls here and there, stairs over there, etc.&quot;) and he hands you the permit on the spot.</p>
<p>We talked to a Seattle restaurateur who is building a restaurant in Denver in an old historic building. They wanted to save the old windows in the building and were concerned they&#39;d run into city regulators who demanded that they replace them all with modern windows. He said that he sheepishly said to the inspector &quot;We&#39;d like to keep these windows if we can&quot; and the inspector said &quot;Of course you are! Those are <em>great</em> windows!&quot; In contrast, we fought with Seattle for months to keep the old windows in our building and had to jump through hoops in the construction and design (not to mention the money) to get the city to begrudglingly let us keep them.</p>
<p>I&#39;m an advocate for good regulations, but too much or the wrong kind isn&#39;t good for anyone. I can&#39;t see the wisdom in many of the rules the city has and I think  most of the problem is some combination of bureaucracy, a misunderstanding of the spirit of the building code and just plain laziness. On the windows issue, they told us our old single-pane windows leaked too much air so we had to make the rest of the building more energy-efficient (which we&#39;re doing) and then they told us that they didn&#39;t leak enough air so we are required to put in a special venting system that will bring air into the building! Both can&#39;t be correct! We even had the guy who wrote the new super-aggressive 2014 energy code arguing with the city on our behalf and they thought <em>he</em> was wrong.</p>
<p>For our electricity, they gave us an electrical permit in March to do the necessary work to upgrade our electricity. A week before our electrician was set to start on the electrical work in June, they called and said that they were wrong to grant us a permit because we have to take our power from a different source, that we can&#39;t start work and would have to wait in line 3 months to get a new permit. That would be 3 months that we wouldn&#39;t have had to wait had they known their own rules 3 months earlier. After several weeks of wrangling, they promised to get our work done earlier than 3 months, but we&#39;re still waiting to see if that turns out to be true.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are worse cities to deal with, but Seattle should be better than this.</p>
