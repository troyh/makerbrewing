Here you can see the form for the floor constructed, almost ready for the concrete:</p>

<p>The entire floor of the building will have a new concrete slab. But only <a href="/news/2014-08-26-permitted">recently</a> did we get our permit approved to do the brewery part of the floor so we have to do it in two parts. This part will not have any radiant heating in it, since we don&#39;t want to heat the area around the cold fermenters.</p>
<p>We are putting radiant heat in the rest of the building because it&#39;s the most-efficient way to heat a room. I love the silence of radiant heat because a ceiling blower isn&#39;t fighting heat&#39;s natural upward movement. The brewery should feel, and sound, great during winters!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we lose about 6-9 inches (depending on where the measurement is taken on the 100 year-old uneven floor) of height because the new floor will be on top of the old floor. That doesn&#39;t seem like much when you have 17- to 20-foot ceilings, but the equipment is so tall that it did create some difficulties with fitting the equipment in.</p>
<p>Our trench drains also arrived recently:</p>
<p><img src="/img/news/IMG_0370.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>They&#39;re stainless steel and were manufactured and delivered quickly by <a href="http://www.stainlessdrains.com">stainlessdrains.com</a>, a company we found while trying to order drains from the traditional trench drain manufacturers that breweries use. This company was great to work with. All the other drain manufacturers gave us the run-around just trying to get a price because they want to work with plumbers instead of their customers so they can keep the price a secret (20th-century sales models!). StainlessDrains.com talked directly to us, told us exactly how much it&#39;d cost and provided a shipping date that they beat. I was a little concerned given that they aren&#39;t one of the recommended drain manufacturers, but they build drains for Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo, so they must be well-made. They sure look like they are so far and the only one we found that are in one piece -- all the others were in pieces that were either welded are assembled on site.</p>
<p>Because they&#39;re stainless steel drains, we are also installing stainless steel piping all the way to the city&#39;s cast iron piping. I figure there&#39;s no sense in paying for stainless steel drains if they drain to PVC and, given that it&#39;s buried in concrete, I wanted to feel confident about its durability.</p>
